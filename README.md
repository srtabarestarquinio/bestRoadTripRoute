# bestRoadTripRoute
Design and implement an application for scheduling road trips in the continental USA. Once implemented, your solution must find a route from the starting city to the ending city in a way that visits each of the events or places of interest while keeping the number of miles driven to a minimum.

Main file is leastDistanceRoute.java, this file will call helper files calcDistances.java and DijkstraAlgorithm.java.
